This project is a multi-page website for SHARE-RIDE, an AI-powered, SaaS-ready ride-hailing dispatch system (Uber-style). It demonstrates a production-grade platform with real-time location tracking, smart AI driver matching, sentiment feedback, admin dashboards, and more. The website is built using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5 for responsive layouts, interactive UI components, and visually appealing designs.

The site includes a minimum of 10 pages, with cohesive dark theme styling (black background with orange-peach gradient accents), glassmorphism cards, fixed navbar, and consistent components across all pages. No external images are required—visuals are handled via gradients and Bootstrap Icons.
Key features implemented:

Bootstrap Integration: CDN-linked Bootstrap 5 for grid system, containers, rows, columns, and responsive design.

Navigation: Fixed navbar with dropdowns.
Interactivity: Carousels (sliders), accordions, modals, tooltips, form validation, hover effects, and transitions.

Styling: Custom CSS overrides for glassmorphism cards, gradients, timelines, avatars, filters, and more.

Pages: Home, About, Services, Contact, Portfolio, Album, Blog, FAQ, Team, Pricing, Returns (Privacy and Terms pages excluded as per request, but links remain in footers for completeness).

This meets the Website Development Assignment requirements for Bootstrap 5 integration, responsive design, UI/UX creativity, navigation/interactivity, and project organization.
